# ledctrlv2.1

ledctrl is a 24-channel controller for led-strips - it uses a stm32f407 to pwm-control 12x QS6K1 MOSFETs for the channels, and a microsd-card slot to store animation/program data.

Prototypes were built and were working, but the project didn't progress any further and was abandoned. 

The modified micropython-version with the custom mappings is missing, but could be easily recreated.
