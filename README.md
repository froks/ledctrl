# ledctrlv2.1

ledctrl is a 24-channel controller for led-strips - it uses a stm32f407 to pwm-control 12x QS6K1 MOSFETs for the channels.

Prototypes were built and were working, but the project didn't progress any further. The modified micropython with the custom mappings is missing, but could be easily recreated.
